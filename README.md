# Python 101 Automation Projects

This repository hosts a suite of security-focused automation tools developed as part of the Python 101 course by TCM Security Academy. These projects are designed to teach the principles of ethical hacking and automation using Python.

## Projects

### Project #1: SSH Brute Forcer
`ssh_bruteforcer.py` - Automates brute force attacks against SSH servers to find valid credentials.

### Project #2: SHA256 Password Cracker
`sha256_password_cracker.py` - Cracks SHA256 hashes using dictionary attacks.

### Project #3: Web Login Brute Forcer
`web_login_bruteforcer.py` - Performs brute force attacks on web login forms.

### Project #4: SQL Injection Exploiter
`sql_injection_exploiter.py` - Detects and exploits SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Project #5: Binary Search SQL Injection
`sql_injection_binary_search.py` - Uses binary search to optimize SQL injection data extraction.

## Disclaimer

These tools are for educational purposes and should be used on systems with explicit authorization. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
